=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use unless CONDITION, MODULE => ARGUMENTS;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The construct

  use unless CONDITION, MODULE => ARGUMENTS;

has no effect if C<CONDITION> is true.  In this case the effect is
the same as of

  use MODULE ARGUMENTS;

Above C<< => >> provides necessary quoting of C<MODULE>.  If not used (e.g.,
no ARGUMENTS to give), you'd better quote C<MODULE> yourselves.

=head1 BUGS

The current implementation does not allow specification of the
required version of the module.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<if> provides the same functionality as this module, without the negation.
It is also in core (since version C<5.6.2>).

L<Module::Requires> can be used to conditionally load one or modules,
with constraints based on the version of the module.

L<Module::Load::Conditional> provides a number of functions you can use to
query what modules are available, and then load one or more of them at runtime.

L<provide> can be used to select one of several possible modules to load,
based on what version of Perl is running.
